# Boosts
# -------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Boosts enhance foragers decisions by making them more informed

# Forager with high agility and perception are more likely to go for 
# nearer food and foragers, whereas foragers with high strength or
# endurance are more likely to go further for food and foragers. 
# boost1_threshold sets a value that defines when a attriubte is "high".
# boost2_threshold unlocks more powerful decision making, allowing the
# forager to consider the most sustaining food or compatible forager.

boost2_threshold = 6 # 0 <= x <= 10
